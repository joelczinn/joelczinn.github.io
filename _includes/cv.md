I am currently a PhD candidate in the Astronomy department at Ohio State University working with [Dennis Stello](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/dennis-stello) and [Marc Pinsonneault](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pinsono/) on red giant asteroseismology with Kepler and K2, most recently in the context of the [Galactic Archaeology Programme](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/k2gap/). I am interested in testing stellar models with the asteroseismic sample of K2, and am currently working on doing just that.

For those that use *Gaia* Data Release 1 (TGAS) in their work, see [my paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09416) for a formula to correct spatially-correlated systematic errors in TGAS parallaxes.

For those interested in stellar classification in the era of big photometric surveys like LSST, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04834), where we show that Gaussian processes are useful for modeling and classifying quasi-periodic stars.




I received A.B. magna cum laude from Princeton University in Astrophysical Sciences, where I worked with [Michael Strauss](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/index.html) on identifying AGN-galaxy strong lenses in SDSS; [Richard Gott](http://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/j-richard-gott-iii) on predicting Slow-Roll dark energy constraints with Planck; and [David Spergel](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/) on AGN-galaxy magnification weak lensing in WISE and BOSS.
