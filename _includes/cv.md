I received A.B. magna cum laude from Princeton University in Astrophysical Sciences, where I worked with [Michael Strauss](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/index.html) on identifying AGN-galaxy strong lenses in SDSS; [Richard Gott](http://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/j-richard-gott-iii) on predicting Slow-Roll dark energy constraints with Planck; and [David Spergel](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/) on AGN-galaxy magnification weak lensing in WISE and BOSS.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Astronomy department at Ohio State University working with [Dennis Stello](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/dennis-stello) and [Marc Pinsonneault](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pinsono/) on red giant asteroseismology with Kepler and K2, most recently in the context of the [Galactic Archaeology Programme](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/k2gap/).
