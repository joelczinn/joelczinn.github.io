    <p> I've developed two planetarium shows that speak to
    astronomy's societal significance: one that explores how
    astronomy has inspired art throughout human history, from
    Pythagoras to van Gogh; and one that investigates how historical
    theories of comets, supernovae, and planetary motions may have
      contributed to the understandings of the Star of Bethlehem.</p>

    <p>The show on art and astronomy premiered at the planetarium as part of
    a larger program of "An evening of astronomy and art", where I
    supplied art and writing supplies for participants to create
      their own astronomical masterpieces on the rooftop.</p>

      <p>Extending my outreach
    beyond campus, I organized an open mic night of sorts dubbed
    "Studio lab": we welcomed
    artists and scientists alike who had a creative project that they
    were working on or had finished that was inspired by science. The
    format riffed on the open mic: anyone present could show their
    work â€” as long as they first described the science that it conveys.</p>
