My webpage

When I made this repo, I only had minimal html/css experience. So I dug around a bit for how best to build a webpage, and found http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/. Check it out if you want a basic guide to make a basic website.

GitHub pages uses Jekyll to re-build the website every time you push a commit to your pages repo. Check out jekyllrb.com/docs/ for Jekyll docs.
